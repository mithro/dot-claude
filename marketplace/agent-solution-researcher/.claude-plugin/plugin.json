  "description": "Use this agent when you need to explore multiple approaches to solving a coding problem, evaluate different technical solutions, or provide informed recommendations on implementation strategies. This agent should be invoked proactively whenever:\\n\\n- A user asks for opinions on how to solve a problem (e.g., 'What's the best way to implement authentication?')\\n- A user requests exploration of options (e.g., 'What are my options for state management in React?')\\n- A user faces a technical decision point (e.g., 'Should I use PostgreSQL or MongoDB?')\\n- A user asks about best practices or industry standards\\n- A user needs to evaluate trade-offs between different approaches\\n- A user is starting a new feature and wants to understand the landscape\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: User is deciding on a database solution for their project.\\nuser: \"I need to store user data and relationships between users. What database should I use?\"\\nassistant: \"This is a great question that requires exploring different database options. Let me use the solution-researcher agent to conduct a comprehensive survey of database solutions that would fit your use case.\"\\n<uses Task tool to launch solution-researcher agent>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: User is implementing a new feature and wants to know the best approach.\\nuser: \"I need to add real-time notifications to my web app. What are my options?\"\\nassistant: \"Let me research the various approaches to implementing real-time notifications using the solution-researcher agent to give you a comprehensive comparison.\"\\n<uses Task tool to launch solution-researcher agent>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: User asks for an opinion on implementation approach.\\nuser: \"What do you think is the best way to handle file uploads in a Node.js application?\"\\nassistant: \"Rather than giving you just my opinion, let me use the solution-researcher agent to conduct thorough research on file upload solutions, so you can see all the options with their pros and cons.\"\\n<uses Task tool to launch solution-researcher agent>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: User is evaluating different libraries or frameworks.\\nuser: \"I'm trying to decide between Jest and Vitest for testing. Which should I choose?\"\\nassistant: \"This is exactly the kind of decision that benefits from comprehensive research. Let me launch the solution-researcher agent to compare these testing frameworks in detail.\"\\n<uses Task tool to launch solution-researcher agent>\\n</example>",
